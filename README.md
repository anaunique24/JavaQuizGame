# JavaScript Quiz Game

## Description
- In this project I have written original JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to construct an application to quiz users on their knowlegde of JavaScript.
- On this website, you will have the ability to click through the game to test your knowledge and save your score at the end on local storage.

## Usability
 To use this website:
- Start by reading the instructions then pressing the "start quiz" button to begin
- Once the button is pressed, a timer will start to countdown. With every missed question, 10 seconds will be deducted.
- After all questions are answered, you will be prompted to enter your intitals to save your time and score.
- By refreshing the page, you will be able to take the quiz again but still save your previous scores.
